Dear Hiring Manager,

I am Taufeeq. I have been building web applications for almost 3 years now. I have a professional experience of 1 year.  
I am an expert in React/Next and Node.js. I worked a little bit in Jetpack Compose in Kotlin and also SpringBoot. 
I know Java, Python, Javascript, and Typescript and can code in any language required for the task at hand.

The assignment for bytespeed backend role is done and you can verify it here at https://bytespeed-backend-challenge.onrender.com/identify.
Use Postman because it's a POST route.

Example payload in the body is :<br/>

{  <br/>
    "email":"themaestrotaufeeq@gmail.com",<br/>
    "phoneNumber":"8919049647"
    <br/>
}

Also checkout my Large project that I have been working on for the past few months => https://github.com/taufeeq-ahmed/tickets-microservice.
It's also built in Typescript/Node.js and is much bigger than this assignment.

I will be eagerly waiting for your reply, I believe we can build bigger and better things together.

Warm Regards,
